##BlackJack

This BlackJack program simulates a game of Blackjack where a player competes against a dealer. The player starts with a random balance, which they use to place bets each round. A standard 52-card deck is used, and cards are dealt randomly to both the player and dealer. The player can choose to *Hit*, *Stand*, or *Double Down*, the latter of which doubles the wager but only hits once, then ends the turn. The player is aiming to get a hand total as close to 21 as possible without going over. If anyone gets BlackJack (21), they win. If both people end up with the same value, it is a tie.

The game can be played until the player chooses to quit or their balance runs out. At the end of the game, a detailed summary displays the player's overall performance, including wins, losses, ties, and final balance. The program uses modular programming as well as C++ features like *structs* for card management, *operator overloading* for comparisons and display, and *arrays* for storing hands.
